This is done to avoid conflicts while merging from different branches. gitignore file for java, that consider a lot of different files that are not included (jar, war, classpath, files that IDEA and other IDE generates and so on). 
2. What does fast-forward in git mean? 
 The tip of your main branch is moved forward to the end of your feature branch using fast-forward merges. This cleanly integrates your feature branch back into your main branch while maintaining the sequential order of all contributions made there.Fast forward merge can be performed when there is a direct linear path from the source branch to the target branch.
3. Why should you have different branches? 
Each developer can separate their work from other developers' efforts by branching out from the original code base. Additionally, it makes eventual version fusion in Git much simpler.
4. In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have? 
One master branch and usually each person having one branch to add their changes
